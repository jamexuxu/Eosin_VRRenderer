# Eosin_VRRenderer for MMDShow and mmd2timeline Player

## Overview

This is an extended version of [Eosin's VRRenderer Plugin](https://hub.virtamate.com/resources/video-renderer-for-3d-vr180-vr360-and-flat-2d-audio-bvh-animation-recorder.11994/) for Virt-A-Mate. See that link for further information.

In order to better support MMD recording, I made some modifications previously. Later, I discovered [yunidatsu's Modified Version](https://github.com/yunidatsu/Eosin_VRRenderer), which includes a highly useful multi-threaded rendering feature. I forked that version and merged my previous changes with it, resulting in this version.

**This version is recommended to be used in conjunction with MMDShow (version 3.0.0 or higher) and mmd2timeline Player (version 1.5 or higher).**
